            <description><![CDATA[We’ll build a web app to solve every developer's most common problem – finding an excuse to justify our messy work! And will do it with a single config file that covers the full-stack app architecture plus several dozen lines of code. In the quickest possible way, so we can’t excuse ourselves from building it!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I have been programming professionally for over a decade, using a variety of languages day-to-day including Ada, C, Java, Ruby, Elixir, and JavaScript. I’ve also tried some obscure ones, albeit less frequently and for different purposes: MIPS assembly language and OCaml for academic work (I’m a BS, MS, and PhD dropout in CS), and Zig for some side projects. In short, I like learning new languages (at least at a surface level) and have been exposed to different programming paradigms, including functional.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Except for a handful of companies who send people to Mars or develop AGI, most startups don’t seem to offer a good reason to join them. You go to their websites and all you see is vague, baseless, overly generic mission-schmission/values-schvalues HR nonsense that supposedly should turn you into a raving fan of whatever they’re doing and make you hit that “Join” button until their servers crash. Well…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React & Node.js. A number of times we've been asked “Why are you bothering creating a new language for web app development? Isn’t Github Copilot\ soon going to be generating all the code for developers anyhow?*”.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[About a year or so ago, brother and I started discussing how awesome it would be to have a programming language that would understand what “web app” means. Such language would, on one hand, serve as an expressive specification of the web app, while on the other hand, it would take care of “boring” work for us, while we could focus on the business logic specific for our web app.]]></description>
