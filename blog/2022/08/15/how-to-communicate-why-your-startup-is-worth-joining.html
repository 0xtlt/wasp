You go to their websites and all you see is vague, baseless, overly generic mission-schmission/values-schvalues HR nonsense that supposedly should turn you into a raving fan of whatever they’re doing and make you hit that “Join” button until their servers crash. Well…</p><p>Some people think that’s because most startups aren’t worth joining. I disagree. This argument generalizes one’s own reasons for joining a startup onto every other human being out there, which is unlikely to be true. I think most startups, no matter how ordinary, <em>do</em> have a reason to join them; <em>a good reason</em>; even <em>many good reasons</em> — they just fail to communicate them well. They’re like a shy nerd on Tinder with an empty bio and no profile pic: a kind, intelligent, and thoughtful human being who, unfortunately, will be ruthlessly swiped left — not because he’s a bad match but because his profile doesn’t show why he’s a good one.</p><p>Visually, this “Tinder profile problem” looks like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates not seeing why to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-1-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, look what would happen if a startup communicated a bit better. Suddenly, our candidates could see a reason to join. If the reason is good, they might even swipe right.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing one reason to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-2-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>But most startups have <em>many</em> good reasons to join them. If only they communicated well, the outcome would be something like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing many reasons to join; one candidate already running for it" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-3-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, you’re probably wondering just what exactly those reasons are.</p><p>Here’s a rough list:</p><ol><li>The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</li><li>The team is great</li><li>The culture is amazing</li><li>The business is doing well</li></ol><p>However, if you just copy this list and paste it on your jobs page, you will accomplish nothing. The candidates will never believe you. What you need to do instead is to <em>supply them with a system of concretes (facts) from which their minds will form these abstract conclusions.</em></p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Instead of declaring that “the founders are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent,” show them how so, like Sarah from Canny does by writing comprehensive year-in-review blog posts for <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four years in a row</a>.</li><li>Instead of proclaiming that “the founders are humble and can have fun,” show them how so, like Michael from Fibery did by becoming a hero of <a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this hilarious page</a>. (No businessy founder would ever agree to make this public. Michael did.)</li><li>Instead of purporting that “the team is great” or “you’ll work alongside very smart people” (God, I hate that one!), show them who exactly those people are, as PostHog does <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Wasp does <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In the rest of the post, I’ll go through the four broad reasons to join a startup one by one and show real-life examples of communicating them well. In the end, I will explain how these four reasons, communicated well, fuse into two compelling messages that will interest any candidate.</p><p>One last thing. For the sake of clarity and comprehension, I will write in the second person. Instead of saying “candidates would never believe them,” I will say “you would never believe them.” It’s much easier to read and understand.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well"></a><strong>Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it"></a><strong>1.

Sadly, only a few leverage this asset. In most cases, all you get is a small round pic with a fancy title and a few abstract, high-level sentences that cause no excitement whatsoever. What a shame!</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="how-canny-commmunicates-who-their-founders-are"></a><strong>How Canny commmunicates who their founders are</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#how-canny-commmunicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="founder-stories-blog-category"></a><strong>Founder Stories blog category</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#founder-stories-blog-category" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The first notable thing Canny does is the <a href="https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Founder Stories category</a> in their blog. By quickly skimming the posts, you can understand that Sarah and Andrew (the founders):</p><ul><li>Accept their mistakes, talk about them, and learn from them. Even if the issue is sensitive, like firing people. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/reflections-two-year-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reflections from the last 2 years as a founder</a>, <a href="https://canny.io/blog/hire-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First hire to first fire</a>.)</li><li>Are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent people. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup</a>, <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected</a>.)</li><li>Have very definite, clear values. But, more importantly, stand up to them, even if that means losing revenue. (<a href="https://canny.io/blog/saying-no-big-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saying no to big customers</a>.)</li></ul><p>If they just pinned this list of virtues to their Jobs page, you would never believe them. Instead, Sarah and Andrew show what actions they take, how they work, how they think, <em>how they live</em> — and you make up their own mind about what kind of people Sarah and Andrew are from seeing all that. The difference is enormous.</p><p>Note their writing style. They don’t claim to be know-it-alls with titles like “How <em>to</em> bootstrap your startup.” Instead, they write “How <em>we</em> Bootstrapped <em>our</em> SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability.” They cover only what they know instead of overgeneralizing. This shows both expertise and humility.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#x27;s Founder Stories blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-founder-stories-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="personal-instagram"></a><strong>Personal Instagram</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#personal-instagram" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The second thing Sarah and Andrew do well to communicate who they are is their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carryoncode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. They don’t post glamorous keynote appearances, as many entrepreneurs do. They share the actual day-to-day working life — both the fun and the struggle. It gives you a good idea of what they’re after in life. (Not keynotes.) That’s why it works, and that’s why people love it.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A photo from Sarah and Andrew&#x27;s personal Instagram" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-instagram-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p><em>Side note: Sarah explains how she develops the Canny brand in <a href="https://canny.io/blog/building-your-brand-with-storytelling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.

In these monthly posts, Michael honestly shares everything that’s going on with Fibery, including the good, the bad, and the ugly: firing people for poor performance, losing important customers, and failing to reach product-market fit. The fact that he’s already written 45 of those (as of Aug 2022) is also telling. And he’s not a native English speaker. If he can do that, why can’t you?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#x27;s Startup Diary blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-startup-diary-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="crazy-challenges"></a><strong>Crazy challenges</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#crazy-challenges" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Besides writing the Startup Diary, Michael also embarks on crazy challenges like <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/100-posts-about-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing 100 posts about products</a>. Only a passionate, driven person would commit to such a thing. You cannot help but respect him for it. (Before this challenge, he wrote 100 Medium posts in 100 days in 2018. You can read them <a href="https://mdubakov.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Just scroll a few screens to reach the old stuff.)</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery&#x27;s 100 posts about products blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-challenges-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>If you look carefully, you’ll notice that Michael’s thinking about building a company is different from Sarah’s. For example, he despises the gentle, soothing “Oh don’t worry that it didn’t work out; you did such a good work!” approach, which is ubiquitous in the modern startup world. Instead, he states that <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/dissatisfaction-leads-to-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissatisfaction leads to progress</a>, referring to the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Not quite my tempo”</a> scene from Whiplash. Does that make you like him more than Sarah?</p><p>It depends. If you believe that being soft and balanced is better, you’ll go with Sarah; if you believe that real progress comes only from working yourself to the bone, you’ll go with Michael (or Elon). The important thing is that both founders have their own, unique viewpoints of how things should be done, and that they communicate these viewpoints as-is instead of chopping their legs off to fit the latest Procrustean fad.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry"></a><strong>In-depth, original blog posts about the industry</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Some entrepreneurs say that doing a startup is like “jumping off a cliff and building your wings on the way down.” Some of it might be true. But if you want <em>reasonable</em> people to jump with you, you better tell them that you have a degree in engineering and know how to assemble wings in a free fall. Otherwise, the only team you’ll recruit is a suicide squad looking for a splashy hit.</p><p>To communicate his expertise, Michael writes in-depth, original, theoretical posts about the nature of knowledge management and organizational productivity. These posts are gems, both literally and metaphorically. (They’re filed under the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gems category</a> in the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery blog</a>.)</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-vision-v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery.io Vision v.1: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/the-next-wave-of-work-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Wave of Work Management Software</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/augmenting-organizational-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmenting Organizational Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/use-networks-to-prioritize-product-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Networks to Prioritize Product Features</a></li></ul><p>After reading these articles, you understand not only that Michael really knows how to build wings while falling off the cliff, but that he has already jumped a few times. (Prior to Fibery, Michael had worked on knowledge management for more than a decade. He also had built a successful project management software, <a href="https://www.apptio.com/products/targetprocess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targetprocess</a>.) You know that he’s an expert who can be trusted.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Michael writes differently from Sarah, they both leverage what they’re good at. Sarah does not try to produce treatises on software development philosophy, and Michael doesn’t gush out with his personal learnings from building a startup. That, I think, is the right way to do it.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are"></a><strong>How PostHog communicates who their founders are</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>PostHog’s founders James and Tim don’t write 100 posts in 100 days or run a personal Instagram. But they’ve come up with something else to communicate what kind of people they are. And it’s something unique.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="well-written-concise-bio"></a><strong>Well-written, concise bio</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#well-written-concise-bio" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>First, both founders have decent <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profiles</a> in the company handbook. These bios are short, clear, and humane. They’re also very specific. Where else have you seen the name of the CEO’s cat?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#x27; bio in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-bio-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="personal-readme-files"></a><strong>Personal README files</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#personal-readme-files" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Second, both James and Tim have an extensive README file (<a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a>, <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>) on how to work with them. These files give you an insight into their productivity habits, interests, and quirks. In fact, after reading them, you will likely have a better idea of the founders than you’d usually get from working at a company for a month!</p><p>For instance, James’s file has sections like:</p><ul><li><strong>Short bio.</strong> Includes very specific details like: “I tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.”</li><li><strong><em>Very clear</em> areas of responsibility.</strong> No need to wonder what the hell the CEO is doing anymore!</li><li><strong>Quirks.</strong> These are remarkably humble and open-minded, like:<ul><li>“If I haven’t responded to something that you’ve sent me, that’s probably because I’ve read it and don’t feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don’t hear back in a reasonable time frame.”</li><li>“I’m a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.”</li><li>Explaining these quirks is an ingenious move. Besides explaining how to work with James, this section communicates that he’s profoundly self-aware and willing to accept and leverage his weaknesses. These qualities are very rare and incredibly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What I value.</strong> In stark contrast to most HR nonsense, these values are very clear, very specific, and written in English rather than HRese. (I just came up with this term: it means “legalese but for HR.”) Here are two examples:<ul><li>“Proactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn’t have hired you if I didn’t trust you. I’d rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don’t get anything done at all.”</li><li>“Directness impresses me. If you don’t like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.”</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to that, there’s also: How I can help you, How you can help me, My goals until end December 2022 (very specific!), Personal strategy, Execution todo (including “1 bike ride a week”!) and Archived todo.</p><p>In summary, this README page is a gem. I wish more founders had them.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins&#x27; README in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-readme-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are"></a><strong>How we at Wasp communicate who our founders are</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page"></a><strong>“Who we are” section of every job description page</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>Matija and Martin (the founders of Wasp) embedded a concise description of who they are right into each <a href="https://www.notion.so/402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description page</a> in Notion.

Their primary tool is the <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostHog Handbook</a>, which covers virtually <em>every</em> aspect of what working at PostHog feels like: interviews, onboarding, training, management, communication, and even firing.

PROGRESS — or, the business is doing well</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#4-progress--or-the-business-is-doing-well" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When you just closed an $80 million Series B or signed Facebook as a customer, communicating progress is easy. You just state these facts. However, most companies need to attract great people way before Series B. In fact, it is these very people who’re going to get you there. As most startups are secretive about how things are going, communicating that things are going <em>somehow</em> — no matter how negligible your progress in contrast to the big guys — becomes quite an advantage. It immediately de-risks the opportunity in the candidate’s eyes. So, if EXPERTISE is about convincing candidates that you know how to build the wings, PROGRESS is about showing them the half-built carcass on your way down. Both are important if you want great people to jump off the cliff with you.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h4 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="how-canny-communicates-their-progress"></a><strong>How Canny communicates their progress</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#how-canny-communicates-their-progress" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>To give candidates a sense that things are moving, that this company is not some long slog but a place where progress is made every day, that they can become a part of something that’s growing and, therefore, can grow themselves, to do all that, Canny does two things.</p><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="year-in-review-blog-posts"></a><strong>“Year in review” blog posts</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#year-in-review-blog-posts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>The first one is their “Year in review” blog post series. Such comprehensive, thoughtful reviews are rare in the startup world. What is even rarer is when these posts span over four consecutive years. It sends a message that the founders are persistent and devoted to making this company successful.</p><p>Below are all Canny’s year-in-review posts in a sequential order:</p><ul><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/lessons-learned-bootstrapping-saas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year in review: Lessons learned from bootstrapping our SaaS startup</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-two-lessons-bootstrapping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year in review: Lessons from our second year of bootstrapping Canny</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-three-lessons-bootstrapped-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year three in review: Lessons from growing our bootstrapped startup</a></li><li><a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected</a></li></ul><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Canny&#x27;s Year in review blog post" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-year-in-review-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h5 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts"></a><strong>Important revenue milestones blog posts</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#important-revenue-milestones-blog-posts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h5><p>In addition to year-in-review posts, Sarah writes about hitting notable revenue milestones.

These tweets work like ads.

They wrote a blog about <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/02/23/journey-to-ycombinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their journey to Y Combinator</a>.

You can’t say “our founders are great.” You need to provide candidates with many-many facts about the founders, which their minds will then fuse into this abstract conclusion. Ditto for expertise, team, culture, and progress. Eventually, these first-level abstractions will blend into still broader ones: “the company is likely to succeed” and “working there will be awesome.”</p><p>Thus, there’s no single, ultimate answer to “why people should join your company.” There’s only a complex system of concrete, specific units of information from which candidates make the answer themselves. In other words, you can’t teach them why your company is likely to succeed and why working here will be awesome. But you can outline the facts and let them learn for themselves. I hope this post shows how to do that outlining well, and I hope you will apply this knowledge to bring talented people onboard and build great things.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostDetailsFull_3kfx"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/blog/tags/startups">startups</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/blog/tags/hiring">hiring</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/blog/tags/wasp">wasp</a></li></ul></div><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-08-15-how-to-communicate-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2022/08/26/how-and-why-i-got-started-with-haskell"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« How and why I got started with Haskell</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">ML code generation vs. coding by hand - what we think programming is going to look like »</div></a></div></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" class="table-of-contents__link"><strong>Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well</strong></a><ul><li><a href="#1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it" class="table-of-contents__link"><strong>1.
