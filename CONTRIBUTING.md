# Contributing to Wasp

Wasp's compiler is built with Haskell. So there are three ways for you to contribute: 
- Haskell-related
- Webdev (React, Node, HTML/CSS, database and so on)
- Documentation

## Before you begin 

- Check the [**Getting Started**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs) guide to get familiar with Wasp's fundamentals. And ideally build an app from the [**Pick a Tutorial**](http://localhost:3001/docs/pick-a-tutorial) page
- Figure out, what you'd like to help with.
