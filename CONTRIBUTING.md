# Contributing to Wasp

Wasp's compiler is built with Haskell. As an output, you'll get a web application written in React and NodeJS. So there are three ways for you to contribute: 
- [Haskell-related](#haskell-related)
- [Web dev](#web-dev) (React, Node, HTML/CSS, database and so on)
- [Tutorials or Example apps](#tutorials-or-example-apps)
- [Documentation](#documentation)

## Before you begin 

- Check the [**Getting Started**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs) guide to get familiar with Wasp's fundamentals. And ideally, build an app from the [**Pick a Tutorial**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/pick-a-tutorial) page
- Figure out what you'd like to help with. It can be code, documentation, tutorials, etc. More on this is below.
- Join our Discord [![**Discord**](https://img.shields.io/discord/686873244791210014?label=chat%20on%20discord)](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) for faster communication and feedback. Also, we'll be glad to help you find the issue you'll enjoy working on, depending on your skill set!

Let's jump right in!

## Haskell-related

Wasp compiler is implemented in Haskell, but you will also see a lot of Javascript and other web technologies because the Wasp compiler transpilers Wasp code into them.

You don't have to be an expert in Haskell to contribute or understand the code since we don't use complicated Haskell features much -> most of the code is relatively straightforward, and we are happy to help with the part that is not.

Check the [**Wasp compiler README**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/README.md) for all the detailed instructions and guides.

[**Haskell-related issues can be found here.**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Ahaskell) 

Feel free to contact us via Discord to ask for an appropriate issue for yourself. Or create new issues directly to work on them.

## Web dev

Wasp is a language for developing full-stack web apps. This means there are plenty of tasks related to web development itself. 

[**Web dev issues can be found here.**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Awebdev)

## Tutorials or Example apps

Another great way to help is to create an app with Wasp! We have an [Examples](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/examples) section on our website. As well as the [Tutorials](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/pick-a-tutorial) page. Both those sections can be improved and updated with your projects. 

All that's required is to create an app. And make a tutorial or a blog post to help other people reproduce your work. Some prominent examples are: [Waspello](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/02/waspello), [Waspleau](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/01/27/waspleau), [It Wasps on My Machine](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/09/05/dev-excuses-app-tutrial) and [To-Do app](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app).

Or you can re-build your existing pet project with Wasp. That would be cool!

## Documentation

It's the simplest one â€” a perfect fit for people without coding skills. If you've found an issue or a broken link or any other problems on our [website](https://wasp-lang.dev/) - please, feel free to improve :)
