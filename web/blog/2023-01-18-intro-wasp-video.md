### Attention YouTube tutorial lovers! ðŸ“¢

We just released a concise video introduction to building a full-stack app with Wasp. At just 10 minutes in length, you can get a quick, guided overview on building with Wasp and its most important features.

The video itself compliments our written [ToDo App Tutorial](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app), which is a great place to start if youâ€™re new to Wasp.

And that's all the news for now. Check it out here:
