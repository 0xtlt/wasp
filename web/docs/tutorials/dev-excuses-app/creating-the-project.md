import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

By now you're already know [how to create a project and install Wasp](/getting-started.md). So, letâ€™s create a new web app project named `ItWaspsOnMyMachine`!

```
wasp new ItWaspsOnMyMachine
```

Changing the working directory:
```
cd ItWaspsOnMyMachine
```

Starting the app:
```
wasp start
```

Now your default browser should open up with a simple predefined text message. Thatâ€™s it! ðŸ¥³ For now â€“ the codebase consists of only two files! `main.wasp` is the config file that defines the applicationâ€™s functionality. And `MainPage.js` is the front-end. Everything else, like `Main.css` can be ignored.
