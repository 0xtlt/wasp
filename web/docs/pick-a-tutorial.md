Congrats, you're now familiar with the basic concepts of Wasp! ðŸ¥³ 

It's time to build something cool and check the capabilities of Wasp in action. Pick one of the app tutorials (there will be more of them with time) and leave us your impressions on <DiscordLink />

<img alt="Let's build!"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/develop-an-app.jpg')}
     style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
     height="400px"
/>

P.S: If you decided to build an app on your own - we'd love to see it! If it's simple enough, let's turn it into a tutorial! Please check our [contribution guide](contributing) for detailed instructions and reach us on Discord.
